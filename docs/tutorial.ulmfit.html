      <td>xxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \n\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is the story about a xxunk - year old boy called , you guessed it , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ( victor xxmaj xxunk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more xxunk than the xxmaj rolling xxmaj xxunk could do in all the years they 've xxunk . xxmaj the movie starts off in ` ugly xxmaj fat ' xxmaj donna 's bedroom where xxmaj victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside xxunk his plans when his best - friend xxmaj harold ( kevin xxmaj xxunk ) comes - a - looking for him . xxmaj caught in the attempt by xxmaj harold and his sister , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas runs off for xxunk control . xxmaj yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been xxunk the xxunk girl in the neighborhood , nothing xxunk young xxmaj victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . xxmaj on a hot , xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where xxmaj victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young xxunk xxmaj judy ( judy xxmaj xxunk ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . xxmaj the relationship that develops between xxmaj victor and xxmaj judy becomes the focus of the film . xxmaj the story also focuses on xxmaj victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj guzman ) , his brother xxmaj nino ( also played by real life brother to xxmaj victor , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) and his sister xxmaj vicky ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj the action follows xxmaj victor between scenes with xxmaj judy and scenes with his family . xxmaj victor tries to xxunk with being an oversexed pimp - daddy , his feelings for xxmaj judy and his grandmother 's conservative xxmaj catholic upbringing . \n\n xxmaj the problems that xxunk from xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are a few , but glaring errors . xxmaj throughout the film you get to know certain characters like xxmaj vicky , xxmaj nino , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj judy and even xxmaj judy 's best friend xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the problem is , we know nothing of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . xxmaj we know that he knows how to lick his lips , and xxunk his xxunk , and carry himself for the sake of xxunk girls into the xxunk , but that 's all . xxmaj we know that xxmaj nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . xxmaj we know his sister xxmaj xxunk , is a gossip - loving girl with an xxunk interest in watching xxup tv . xxmaj we know that xxunk is a hard - working traditional xxmaj xxunk woman who 's trying to raise her kids with xxunk in a world of excess corruption . xxmaj yet where is the titular character , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ? xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \n\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \n\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \n\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj now that xxmaj che(2008 ) has finished its relatively short xxmaj australian cinema run ( extremely limited xxunk screen in xxmaj xxunk , after xxunk ) , i can xxunk join both xxunk of " at xxmaj the xxmaj movies " in taking xxmaj steven xxmaj soderbergh to task . \n\n xxmaj it 's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject , but xxmaj soderbergh 's most recent stinker , xxmaj the xxmaj girlfriend xxmaj xxunk ) , was also missing a story , so narrative ( and editing ? ) seem to suddenly be xxmaj soderbergh 's main challenge . xxmaj strange , after xxunk years in the business . xxmaj he was probably never much good at narrative , just xxunk it well inside " edgy " projects . \n\n xxmaj none of this excuses him this present , almost diabolical failure . xxmaj as xxmaj david xxmaj stratton xxunk , " two parts of xxmaj che do n't ( even ) make a whole " . \n\n xxmaj epic xxunk in name only , xxmaj che(2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film ! xxmaj it certainly has no legs , xxunk as except for its xxunk ultimate resolution forced upon it by history , xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk - long xxunk just goes nowhere . \n\n xxmaj even xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk , the more xxunk of xxmaj australia 's xxmaj at xxmaj the xxmaj movies duo , noted about xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk waste of ( xxunk digital xxunk ) : " you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … " . i too am surprised xxmaj soderbergh did n't give us another xxunk of xxup that somewhere between his xxunk two xxmaj parts , because he still left out massive xxunk of xxmaj che 's " xxunk " life ! \n\n xxmaj for a xxunk of an important but infamous historical figure , xxmaj soderbergh xxunk xxunk , if not deliberately insults , his audiences by \n\n 1 . never providing most of xxmaj che 's story ; \n\n 2 . xxunk xxunk film xxunk with mere xxunk xxunk ; \n\n 3 . xxunk both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; \n\n 4 . barely developing an idea , or a character ; \n\n 5 . remaining xxunk episodic ; \n\n 6 . xxunk proper context for scenes xxrep 3 - whatever we do get is xxunk in xxunk xxunk ; \n\n 7 . xxunk xxunk all audiences ( even xxmaj spanish - xxunk will be confused by the xxunk xxunk in xxmaj english ) ; and \n\n 8 . xxunk xxunk his main subject into one dimension . xxmaj why , at xxup this late stage ? xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \n\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \n\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the " revolutionaries " , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that " ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time " . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \n\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant " revolutionaries " , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \n\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \n\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's " woods " and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \n\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( " i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \n\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \n\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was " uneven " , xxmaj part2 actually " goes rapidly downhill " from there , " xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail " , which " … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid " . \n\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \n\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \n\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is the story about a xxunk - year old boy called , you guessed it , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ( victor xxmaj xxunk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more xxunk than the xxmaj rolling xxmaj xxunk could do in all the years they 've xxunk . xxmaj the movie starts off in ` ugly xxmaj fat ' xxmaj donna 's bedroom where xxmaj victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside xxunk his plans when his best - friend xxmaj harold ( kevin xxmaj xxunk ) comes - a - looking for him . xxmaj caught in the attempt by xxmaj harold and his sister , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas runs off for xxunk control . xxmaj yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been xxunk the xxunk girl in the neighborhood , nothing xxunk young xxmaj victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . xxmaj on a hot , xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where xxmaj victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young xxunk xxmaj judy ( judy xxmaj xxunk ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . xxmaj the relationship that develops between xxmaj victor and xxmaj judy becomes the focus of the film . xxmaj the story also focuses on xxmaj victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj guzman ) , his brother xxmaj nino ( also played by real life brother to xxmaj victor , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) and his sister xxmaj vicky ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj the action follows xxmaj victor between scenes with xxmaj judy and scenes with his family . xxmaj victor tries to xxunk with being an oversexed pimp - daddy , his feelings for xxmaj judy and his grandmother 's conservative xxmaj catholic upbringing . \n\n xxmaj the problems that xxunk from xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are a few , but glaring errors . xxmaj throughout the film you get to know certain characters like xxmaj vicky , xxmaj nino , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj judy and even xxmaj judy 's best friend xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the problem is , we know nothing of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . xxmaj we know that he knows how to lick his lips , and xxunk his xxunk , and carry himself for the sake of xxunk girls into the xxunk , but that 's all . xxmaj we know that xxmaj nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . xxmaj we know his sister xxmaj xxunk , is a gossip - loving girl with an xxunk interest in watching xxup tv . xxmaj we know that xxunk is a hard - working traditional xxmaj xxunk woman who 's trying to raise her kids with xxunk in a world of excess corruption . xxmaj yet where is the titular character , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ? xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \n\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \n\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \n\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj now that xxmaj che(2008 ) has finished its relatively short xxmaj australian cinema run ( extremely limited xxunk screen in xxmaj xxunk , after xxunk ) , i can xxunk join both xxunk of " at xxmaj the xxmaj movies " in taking xxmaj steven xxmaj soderbergh to task . \n\n xxmaj it 's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject , but xxmaj soderbergh 's most recent stinker , xxmaj the xxmaj girlfriend xxmaj xxunk ) , was also missing a story , so narrative ( and editing ? ) seem to suddenly be xxmaj soderbergh 's main challenge . xxmaj strange , after xxunk years in the business . xxmaj he was probably never much good at narrative , just xxunk it well inside " edgy " projects . \n\n xxmaj none of this excuses him this present , almost diabolical failure . xxmaj as xxmaj david xxmaj stratton xxunk , " two parts of xxmaj che do n't ( even ) make a whole " . \n\n xxmaj epic xxunk in name only , xxmaj che(2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film ! xxmaj it certainly has no legs , xxunk as except for its xxunk ultimate resolution forced upon it by history , xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk - long xxunk just goes nowhere . \n\n xxmaj even xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk , the more xxunk of xxmaj australia 's xxmaj at xxmaj the xxmaj movies duo , noted about xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk waste of ( xxunk digital xxunk ) : " you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … " . i too am surprised xxmaj soderbergh did n't give us another xxunk of xxup that somewhere between his xxunk two xxmaj parts , because he still left out massive xxunk of xxmaj che 's " xxunk " life ! \n\n xxmaj for a xxunk of an important but infamous historical figure , xxmaj soderbergh xxunk xxunk , if not deliberately insults , his audiences by \n\n 1 . never providing most of xxmaj che 's story ; \n\n 2 . xxunk xxunk film xxunk with mere xxunk xxunk ; \n\n 3 . xxunk both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; \n\n 4 . barely developing an idea , or a character ; \n\n 5 . remaining xxunk episodic ; \n\n 6 . xxunk proper context for scenes xxrep 3 - whatever we do get is xxunk in xxunk xxunk ; \n\n 7 . xxunk xxunk all audiences ( even xxmaj spanish - xxunk will be confused by the xxunk xxunk in xxmaj english ) ; and \n\n 8 . xxunk xxunk his main subject into one dimension . xxmaj why , at xxup this late stage ? xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \n\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \n\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the " revolutionaries " , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that " ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time " . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \n\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant " revolutionaries " , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \n\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \n\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's " woods " and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \n\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( " i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \n\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \n\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was " uneven " , xxmaj part2 actually " goes rapidly downhill " from there , " xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail " , which " … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid " . \n\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \n\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>

      <td>xxbos i really wanted to love this show . i truly , honestly did . \n\n xxmaj for the first time , gay viewers get their own version of the " the xxmaj bachelor " . xxmaj with the help of his obligatory " hag " xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj james , a good looking , well - to - do thirty - something has the chance of love with 15 suitors ( or " mates " as they are referred to in the show ) . xxmaj the only problem is half of them are straight and xxmaj james does n't know this . xxmaj if xxmaj james picks a gay one , they get a trip to xxmaj new xxmaj zealand , and xxmaj if he picks a straight one , straight guy gets $ 25 , xxrep 3 0 . xxmaj how can this not be fun ? ! xxmaj take my hand , lets xxunk : \n\n xxmaj the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself . xxmaj james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body , the one you 'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before xxunk for xxunk xxunk . xxmaj why they chose to cast xxmaj james as the leading man is beyond me . xxmaj god knows there 's so many other hotter and xxunk homosexual men out there dying to be on xxup tv . \n\n xxmaj aside from his rather average physical appearance , xxmaj james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk . xxmaj even as such , he has this arrogant , xxunk xxunk xxunk about him . xxmaj however , if xxmaj james were standing up against a blank , white wall he 'd xxunk right into in it . i honestly ca n't recall a single interesting or xxunk thing xxmaj james said during the course of the show . xxmaj he is xxup that boring and forgettable . xxmaj in fact , one of the mates flat out xxunk him he was n't feeling a connection . i thought that was the best part of the show . xxmaj also , xxmaj james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying xxunk . xxmaj sound feminine or sound xxunk , but do n't xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk xxunk in the middle of sentences … so painful to sit through . i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking , " please choose a straight guy and xxunk yourself and your unfortunate looking hag " \n\n xxmaj then we have the suitors . a remarkably bland bunch of men who do n't seem to care either way what is happening . xxmaj equally xxunk , they seem to be xxunk from one guy to the next except , " hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair " xxmaj again , xxunk inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show . xxmaj while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles , it would 've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these xxunk drones . xxmaj however , in all their xxunk they still manage to upstage xxmaj james ( which is n't all that hard to do anyway ) , slightly that is . xxmaj you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man . xxmaj and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around xxup each xxup other than with the leading man ? xxmaj very sad . \n\n xxmaj also , i just thought that xxmaj i d point something mentioned on the message xxunk which i felt was actually true : the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys . \n\n xxmaj do n't get me wrong , xxmaj i m not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring , as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute . xxmaj it 's just that overall they were just xxup blah compared to the men you 'd see on shows like a xxmaj shot xxmaj at xxmaj love with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk . \n\n i do n't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show . i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box , i can accept the xxunk , xxunk suitors but xxup please for the love of xxmaj god entertain me just a little . xxmaj no such luck . \n\n xxmaj if you 're expecting drama , intrigue , xxunk , or excitement you will be xxup severely disappointed . xxmaj the biggest " drama " comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in xxmaj new xxmaj york ( how xxunk ! ) . xxmaj as xxunk as that may be i guarantee you , that is the xxup only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show . \n\n xxmaj sure there is the twist , but if you have any semblance of xxmaj xxunk in you , you 'll easily xxunk who 's who ( it was n't hard at all , i was only wrong once . ) xxmaj this show is stacking so much of its xxunk on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else . \n\n xxmaj we get to watch as xxmaj james &amp; xxmaj co xxunk along such exciting activities such as learning how to xxmaj western step dance , shopping for xxunk , visiting a xxunk xxunk , and gay xxunk . xxup yawn . xxmaj sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway . xxmaj that 's one of main problems with the show : xxup no xxup one seems to be enjoying themselves -- they are there just going through the motion trying xxunk hard to appear to have a good time . xxmaj and you really ca nt blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame . \n\n xxmaj finally , the physical aspect is not there . xxmaj there 's no xxunk , no xxunk , no kissing ( ! ) , no xxunk of any sort . xxmaj it 's just " ok that was a boring date , xxmaj i m gon na go back to my ugly , tacky wanna - be xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk dwelling ( quick xxunk on the lips ) xxup xxunk . " xxmaj this show is so xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk it 's ridiculous . i can understand them not wanting to play up the xxunk xxunk nature of homosexual men , but come the xxrep 4 * on . xxmaj people who watch reality xxup tv shows are gon na want more than xxunk xxunk and xxunk kisses . xxmaj this show refuses to compromise . \n\n xxmaj sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be xxunk . i do commend xxmaj bravo for first putting up a show of this nature , but the xxunk incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind xxunk . xxmaj to summarize my three points : xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring = go do something else . xxmaj you 'll have more fun waiting at a doctor 's office for an xxunk , at least they have interesting xxunk there .</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't exactly go the same way in the real life of xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book , xxmaj rocket xxmaj boys , but the movie " october xxmaj sky " ( an xxunk of the book 's title ) is good enough to stand alone . i have not read xxmaj hickam 's memoirs , but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation . xxmaj the film , directed by xxmaj joe xxmaj xxunk and written by xxmaj lewis xxmaj xxunk , xxunk the story of teenager xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam ( jake xxmaj xxunk ) , beginning in xxmaj october of 1957 . xxmaj it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast , bringing news of the xxmaj russian satellite xxmaj xxunk , the first artificial satellite in orbit . xxmaj we see a images of a blue - gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj one of the miners xxunk to the news on a hand - held radio as he enters the elevator xxunk , but the xxunk is lost as he disappears into the darkness , losing sight of the xxunk sky above him . a melancholy violin tune xxunk with this image . xxmaj we then get a xxunk of xxmaj xxunk on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting : xxmaj october 5 , 1957 , xxmaj coalwood , xxmaj west xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj homer and his buddies , xxmaj roy xxmaj lee xxmaj cook ( william xxmaj lee xxmaj scott ) and xxmaj xxunk o'dell ( chad xxmaj xxunk ) , are talking about football xxunk . xxmaj football xxunk are the only way out of the town , and working in the mines , for these boys . " why are the xxunk the only ones who get to go to college , " questions xxmaj homer . xxmaj roy xxmaj lee replies , " they 're also the only ones who get the girls . " xxmaj homer does n't make it in football like his older brother , so he is destined for the mines , and to follow in his father 's xxunk as mine xxunk . xxmaj until he sees the xxunk of light xxunk across the xxmaj october sky . xxmaj then he wants to build a rocket . " i want to go into space , " says xxmaj homer . xxmaj after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother 's ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) xxunk , xxmaj homer xxunk the help of the nerdy xxmaj quentin xxmaj wilson ( chris xxmaj owen ) . xxmaj quentin asks xxmaj homer , " what do you want to know about rockets ? " xxmaj homer quickly xxunk , " everything . " xxmaj his science teacher at xxmaj big xxmaj xxunk xxmaj high xxmaj school , xxmaj miss xxmaj xxunk xxmaj riley ( laura xxmaj xxunk ) greatly supports xxmaj homer , and the four boys work on building rockets in xxmaj homer 's basement . xxmaj his father , however , whose life is the mine , does not support him . xxmaj john xxmaj hickam ( chris xxmaj cooper ) believes that xxmaj homer should n't waste his time on the rockets , that the coal mines are all that matter . xxmaj the coal from the mines is used to make steel , and without steel , the country would be nothing . xxmaj the difficult relationship between xxmaj homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film . xxmaj miss xxmaj riley introduces xxmaj homer to the idea of entering the local science fair , with a chance to go the xxunk and win a college scholarship . " you ca n't just dream your way out of xxmaj coalwood , " she tells xxmaj homer . xxmaj homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets , xxunk the models with each attempt . xxmaj despite the many attempts , the boys do not lose their determination . " what are the chances of us winning that science fair , " o'dell asks xxmaj homer in one of their more xxunk moments . " a million to one , " answers xxmaj homer . " that good ? " o'dell replies , " well , why did n't you say so ? " xxmaj the music , composed by xxmaj mark xxmaj xxunk , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when xxmaj homer xxunk into the mine xxunk and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of xxmaj coalwood . xxmaj xxunk 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj buddy xxmaj xxunk , occasionally pushes the xxunk pieces aside to create a light - hearted mood that xxunk the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners . xxmaj the film , photographed by xxmaj fred xxmaj murphy , also uses colors to set xxunk and xxunk . xxmaj the town of xxmaj coalwood , actually filmed in xxmaj xxunk , is washed with blues , xxunk , and xxunk . xxmaj it 's as if the xxunk from the coal sticks to xxunk faces , clothes , houses , and roads . xxmaj when a couple in a xxunk red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of xxmaj coalwood and the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj the book on xxunk xxunk design that xxmaj miss xxmaj riley gives xxmaj homer is red . xxmaj the red stands out enough against the blue - gray world of xxmaj coalwood to xxunk " getting out " , but it is still subtle . xxmaj the xxunk are xxunk hints of a world that xxmaj homer only dreams of . xxmaj jake xxmaj xxunk xxunk such xxunk , hope , and xxunk as xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real xxmaj homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film . xxmaj chris xxmaj cooper is also xxunk believable as xxmaj homer 's xxunk father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive . xxmaj homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket - building , is aware that the town is dying . xxmaj with the community xxunk , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' xxunk . xxmaj again , xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of xxunk ? " october xxmaj sky " has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough xxunk to keep it real .</td>

( the dance is the xxmaj black xxmaj bottom , no less … the same dance which xxmaj bob xxmaj hope famously taught to xxmaj daisy and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , the xxunk xxunk . ) xxmaj wearing xxunk , riding xxunk , and a xxunk xxunk , xxmaj osa xxmaj johnson starts xxunk - singing while she does high steps and xxunk her xxunk in her attempt to teach this dance to the xxmaj african women . xxmaj meanwhile , they just stand there staring at her , apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . xxmaj it 's a very funny scene , but it has unpleasant undertones . xxmaj osa xxmaj johnson is doing a dance that was xxunk by black xxmaj americans : the implication seems to be that black xxmaj africans should xxunk be able to perform this dance after a brief xxunk ( using natural xxunk , i guess ) because it 's in their blood , or something . \n\n xxmaj i 'll rate ' congorilla ' 4 points out of 10 . xxmaj this film says a little bit about xxmaj african life in the 1930s and rather more about xxmaj american cultural xxunk in that same decade .</td>

      <td>xxbos h xxrep 4 m , want a little romance with your mystery ? xxmaj this has it . i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . xxmaj but how could the romance be ditched when the story 's borrowed from something called a xxmaj xxunk xxmaj romance novel , whatever the heck that is . xxmaj had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . xxmaj the mystery here was n't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of xxmaj mission xxmaj impossible international espionage . xxmaj oh well . i thought xxmaj mel xxmaj harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal … but this xxmaj rob xxmaj stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known xxup tv movie actor . xxmaj the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little xxunk , a little darker , more adventurous . xxmaj one thing that was great about this was the use of real xxmaj european locations . xxmaj that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in xxmaj xxunk but they really were in xxunk beautiful places like xxmaj budapest . xxmaj possibly a xxunk was the director and / or cinematographer 's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . xxmaj not good . xxmaj had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a xxunk and just be a nice part of the background . xxmaj this was just a tv - movie , though , so they had to add some u xxrep 3 m xxunk to the picture and some of that u xxrep 3 m xxunk came from the scenery . xxmaj overall , xxunk really a bad movie . xxmaj i 'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best canadian - hungarian production i have ever seen ! ( and the only that i know of . ) i xxunk xxunk this to be a mediocre made - for - tv movie , giving it a grade of xxup c-</td>
